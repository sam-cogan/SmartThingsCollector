# SmartThingsCollector

## This has now been replaced by the more generic [EventHubCollector](https://github.com/sam-cogan/EventHubCollector) please consider using or migrating to this.
Note that format of the data sent to Cosmos has changed in this generic version, where only the body of the avro file is sent.
